# Color Blocks 2

Now with 1,000,000% more Angular!

Run `npm install` to start!
Color Blocks Factory
Remember our lovely Color Block game made with jQuery? It's ba-aaaack! But this time with more Angular!

The given repo has already converted the game for you, but...

Use an Angular Factory for Settings

We want to separate our colors from the game logic and share the colors across controllers. Move the color array data that runs the game into the provided empty angular factory. You'll have to inject it as a dependency into each controller that uses it.

Add Colors UI

Allow the player to enter new colors into the game from the Settings view. Colors need to match a valid CSS color in order to work in the game!

HARD MODE
Allow the player to edit the colors on the Settings view as well. Hint: Create a way to do CRUD operations.

PRO MODE
Introduce a way to track the player's winning streak high score. Add another route and view for High Scores and allow the player to enter their name when they play a game and beat the current high score. The history of high scores should be displayed on the High Scores view!
